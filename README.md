## For Developers

Due to Chrome's security restrictions, any domain Random.moe runs on MUST have a valid SSL certificate in order to use a user's webcam (excluding localhost).
With small modifications to the source code on this repo to the server.js file, you can run a test demo on Heroku. 

As this is a react project, you must run `npm run build` to any changes made to any file in this repository (exluding server.js)
